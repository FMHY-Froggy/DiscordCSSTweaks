Storage for my personal css tweaks (only public due to how importing css tweaks works in vencord), feel free to use if you want but do note that nothing in the "Premade Tweaks" area is made by me, if you for some reason see this and want your link removed from that section, don't hesitate to drop a request.
Use this link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMHY-Froggy/DiscordCSSTweaks/main/mini.css` to load the css.
